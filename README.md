Android-SwipeControl
====================

Simple library to add swiping functionality to a View.


The latest SNAPSHOT can be found [here](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/com/indatus/jonstaff/androidswipecontrol/library/1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/) - I'm working on getting it properly uploaded to MavenCentral.

## Importing Using Android Studio and Gradle

Using Gradle is the easiest way to incorporate this into your project. Add the following lines inside your `build.gradle` after importing this as a module:

````
dependencies {
    compile project(':library')
}
````

## Disclaimer

This readme is a work in progress and will be updated accordingly. For now, view the samples for a better understanding of how to implement this into your project.
